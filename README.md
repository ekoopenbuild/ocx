## Welcome to Eko Open Source Implementation of the OctopusX Framework
The **Eko Open Source** (EOS) encourages developers to build civic apps, software and tools that power the Lagos State Smart City. These apps need to be interconnected, interaoperable and able to communicate  - using a common open protocol, along a common data highway infrastructure. This is where the **OctopusX Framework** (OCX) comes handy.

The OctopusX (OCX) Framework powers a **grid** (or collection) of _interconnected_ **nodes**. Each **node** can represent a public data service, a private app or a developer terminal.


### The EOS Program
To learn about features and benefits of the program, please visit [ekoopensource.com](https://ekoopensource.com).


### The EOS Grids
The EOS operates 2 **grids**:
1. **Sandbox (Development) Grid**: This is where all training and developmental activities take place, mostly by software developers who want to start building for the _Live_ grid. This **grid** is open to the public but requires registration. To connect with the Sandbox **grid**, [get started here](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki/Chapter-1e:-Sandbox-Grid)
2. **Live (Production) Grid**: This is the primary data grid that securely and efficiently facilitates data movement between government, public and private entities. This grid is not open to the public and requires due registration, verification and approval. To connect with the Live grid, [read more here](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki/Chapter-1f:-Live-Grid)

To learn more about OCX grids and nodes, see the [documentation](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki).


### Getting Started
To start building for the EOS, you are free to [experiment with your own local grid](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki/Chapter-1c:-Setting-Up-Grids) OR [connect to the EOS Sandbox grid](https://doc.com/). Whichever you choose, you'll can continue with any of the following 3 scenarios:
- Learn how to [operate a **Developer Node**](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki/Chapter-2d:-Operating-Nodes) 
- Learn how to [operate a **Corporate Node**](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki/Chapter-2d:-Operating-Nodes) 
- Learn how to [operate a **Public Node**](https://github.com/ekoopensource/ocx/wiki/Chapter-2d:-Operating-Nodes)
